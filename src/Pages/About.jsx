        <h2>About Developer</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Satyam Anand, a passionate full stack web developer dedicated
          to creating efficient, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.
          I specialize in React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Redux,
          and I enjoy building projects that not only work well but also look
          great.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in front-end development,
          especially in building seamless user interfaces and interactive
          experiences. At the same time, I continue to grow my skills on the
          backend, aiming to become a well-rounded developer who can handle both
          client and server-side development.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm constantly learning and exploring new tools and frameworks. I
          believe in clean code, continuous improvement, and building
          applications that genuinely help people.
          <br />
          <br />
          Feel free to check out more of my work or get in touch!
